During my Course on Efficient Algorithms, I stumbled upon a Algorithm called "Push-Relabel" or "Goldberg-Tarjan".

For other algorithms there are great visualisations avaible on Youtube. Sadly, I did not find any suitable ones for my purposes. Therefore I made my own:

![visualisation with an counter example for ford fulkerson](https://github.com/rliebig/push_relabel/blob/main/webp/counter_example_fulkerson.webp)

![visualisation with a rather complex example](https://github.com/rliebig/push_relabel/blob/main/webp/complex_example.webp)

Be aware, if you run this it will generate a lot of files in your current directory.
